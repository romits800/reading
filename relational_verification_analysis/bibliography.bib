	abstract = {Information flow properties of programs can be formalized as hyperproperties specifying the relation of multiple executions. In this paper, we therefore introduce a framework for proving 2-hypersafety properties by means of abstract interpretation. The main idea is to apply abstract interpretation on the self-compositions of the control flow graphs of programs. As a result, our method is inherently capable of analyzing relational properties of even dissimilar programs. Constructing self-compositions of control flow graphs is nontrivial. Therefore, we present an algorithm for constructing quality self-compositions driven by a tree distance measure between the abstract syntax trees of subprograms. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the approach by proving intricate information flow properties of programs written in a simple language for tree manipulation motivated by the Web Services Business Process Execution Language.},
